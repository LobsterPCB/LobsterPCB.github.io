# Build Update - Mar 27

Last week we completed all major features, and presented The Lobster at the Mechatronics Capstone Symposium.

### General Updates

This update is a little late, but for good reason: the Mechatronics Capstone Symposium was last Friday, March 24th!

Prior to Symposium we made some final touches to the machine (including sheathing for our cables), recorded demonstration videos, and prepared a live demo for the Symposium.

The Symposium itself was great; the Lobster worked as expected and overall reception was highly positive.
